The author reviewed the early studies of the two dimensional quantum antiferromagnets, especially that carried out by the ED approach before the year 2000. The model considered include the J1-J2 model on the square lattice, the Heisenberg model on the Kagome lattice, and the Heisenberg - ring-exchange model on the triangular lattice. An important point made in this review is that there are two types of spin liquid state, with the second type host an exceptionally large number of singlet excitations below the spin triplet gap. There seems to be no local effective field theory description for this second type of spin liquid phase. The Kagome Heisenberg model and the triangular ring-exchange model are the most important example of such novel type of spin liquid behavior. It seems that the extensive ground state degenracy of the classical model remains intact even if one include the quantum fluctuation on the Kagome lattice. The review also provides some useful information on the RVB theory, VBC phase, dimer model, and ring-exchange interaction.
