This thesis presents a thourough review on the application of the PDW picture to the pseudogap phenomena of the cuprates. The PDW picture combines the particle-hole and particle-particle channel order to account for the spectral characteristic of the pseudogap phase that evidencing both particle-hole symmetric and particle-hole asymmetric ordering channel. However, is a static order parameter in the particle-hole channel indeed needed to the account for the particle-hole asymmetric signinature in the electron spectrum? Anyway, the normal self-energy of the electron also breaks the particle-hole symmetry.
