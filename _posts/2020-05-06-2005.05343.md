The authors studied the criterion for the occurence of intrinsic sign problem in quantum many body system fro a effective field theory perspective. It actually also serves as a well-written introduction to the notions in the topogolical quantum field theory. Some conclusion such as the chiral state has intrinsic sign problem seems not surprising, since the non-locality of the quantum mechanics precludes its representation in term of any classical notions.
