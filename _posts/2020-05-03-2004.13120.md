    - AF spin fluctuation

The authors calculated the dynamical spin susceptibility of the t-t'-U model using the DCA approach. They find that AF spin fluctuation in the underdoped regime is gradually replaced by ferromagentic spin fluctuation in the overdoped regime. The claimed that the superconductivity ends in the overdoped regime as a result of both the decrease in the AF spin fluctuation strength and the increae in the impurity scattering. The DCA result may provide a benchmark of the strength in the AF spin fluctuation in the cuprates. It is curious that nothing special happens at the Lifshitz transition point.
