The authors studied the interplay between the normal and the anomalous self-energy effect in a quantum critical model system. The paper provides a review on possible origin of the various type of critical fluctuation spectrum and calculated how the pairing and the non-Fermi liuqid behavior depends on the exponent of the critical fluctuation. It may serve as a simplified model realization of the non-Fermi liquid state. It also serves as a model system to study the relation between the normal and anomalous self-energy correction in the cuprate. The existence of multiple pairing channels in the superconducting regime may have some observable consequences. It is not clear to what extend the model is realistic(with a momentum independent self-energy) for the cuprates and the perturbative treatment(Elishaberg theory) is valid(a QMC simulation may be possible).
