The author calculated the specific heat anomaly due to AFM-QCP deep inside a nodeles superconducting dome at the gaussian level. They find a T square behavior in C(T) right at the QCP. However, the existence of the AFM-QCP inside the superconducting dome implies the coexistence of the SC and AFM order in the system, which is clearly not the case at the pseudogap end point of the cuprates. The result may have relevance to the iron-based superconductor, provided that the microscopic coexistence of the SC and the AFM order can be verified.
