The author reviewed the early studies of the two dimensional quantum magnet, especially that carried out by the ED approach before 2000. The model considered include the J1-J2 model on square lattice, Kagome Heisenberg model, triangular ring-exchange model. An important point made in this review is that there are two types of spin liquid state, with the second type host exceptional large number of singlet excitation below the triplet gap. There seems to be no effective field theory description for the second type of spin liquid phase. The Kagome Heisenberg model and the triangular ring-exchange model are the most important example of such novel type of spin liquid. It seems that the extensive ground state degenracy of the classical model remains intact even if one include the quantum fluctuation on the Kagome lattice. The review also provides some useful information on the RVB theory, VBC phase, dimer model, and ring-exchange interaction.
