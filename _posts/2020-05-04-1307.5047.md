INS result on the spin fluctuation spectrum of the KLHAF material herbertsmithite. Featureless spectrum(but obviously shaper than the prediction of a local singlet state) is observed with pronounced low energy hump caused by impurity contribution. Curiously, the low energy hump peaks around the M point, which is inconsistent with a local impurity picture.  In a related NMR measurement(1511.02174), the impurity contribution is sucessfully subtracted out, revealing a gapped spectrum.
