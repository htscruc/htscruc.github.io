The authors simulated the phase diagram and prapagator of both the local spin and the electron in a two-band version of the spin-Fermion model with QMC. They compared the result with the Hertz-Millis theory. They found agreement with the prediction os such a pertubative treatment in a substantial temperature range, with the only disagreement on the temperature dependence of the renormalized spin susceptiblity(inverse proprotional to the square of temperature). No evidence of the z=1 regime predicted by the SS Lee theory at low temperature is found in the simulation. The use of the QMC to aid the analytical understanding of the spin-Fermion model seems to be valuable route to pursuit.
