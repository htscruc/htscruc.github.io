The authors studied the non-Hermitian effect in the quasiparticle dynamics in a heavy-Fermion system, which has momentum-dependent hybridization gap and temperature-dependent scattering rate. The competition between the hybridization and the dissipation results in the appearence of a dissipated Fermi arc. This work work is conceptually related to our work on the electron-doped cuprate(arXiv:1803.08226). The problem is that if one can stabilize a Fermi arc with totally coherent quasiparticle on it in the zero temperature limit. Such a possiblity is allowed in principle by the many body theory.
