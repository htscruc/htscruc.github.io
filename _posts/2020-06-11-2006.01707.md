The authors studied the thermodynamic and change transport properties of the Hubbard model on the square and triabgular lattice both at the half-filling and finite doping with the finite temperature Lanczos and the DMFT method. While there are strong finite size effect in these results and are thus reliable only at rather high temperature, they can nevertheless be used as a benchmark for future study on the Hubbard model.
