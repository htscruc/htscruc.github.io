A variational study of the spin dynamics of the KLHAF. Maximum in the static structure factor occurs at the M point in the Dirac spin liquid but at the K point in the zero-flux state. The projected spectrum agrees qualitatively with the mean field prediction(with only nearest-neighboring RVB parameter), in particular, the gaplessness of the spectrum at the M and the M' point. The existence of the Dirac node at the M' point is claimed to be the evidence of the fractiionalization of the translational symmetry. However, the low energy spectral weight around the M and M' point may not be relevant to the experimental observation, which seems to imply a gapped ground state when the gapless impurity contribution is subtracted out.
