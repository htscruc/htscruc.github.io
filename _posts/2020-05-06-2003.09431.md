This is an attempt to check the prediction of the Eliashberg theory on the electron and Boson prapagator of a spin-Fermion type model with the QMC simulation. It is claimed that the self-energy at finite temperature has a different analytical form as compared to that at zero temperature. Extension of the Eliashberg theory to finite temperature is found to agree with the QMC result. The author provides extensive anaylytical estimate on the scaling form of the propagator, but the result seem to be not very useful in the most generic frequency regime. The lattice version of the Eliashberg theory seems to compare well the the QMC result. This may already suffice, since it seems that almost no one would care about the the inaccurate analytical form the propagator. The special role of the zero frequency Boosnic mode at finite temperature is again the origin of the seemingly inconsistency. A related work on the electron-phonon system is presented in arXiv:2004.01281. These work raise the problem of what is the true strength of the QMC simulation on low energy effective models - verifing the prediction of the perturbative treatment, or go beyond it?
