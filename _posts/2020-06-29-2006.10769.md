This paper compares the prediction on the one-particle and two-particle observables of the half-filled Hubbard model on square lattice with NN hopping from various numerical and analytical methods. The evolution from incoherent metal at high temperature to insulator with AF pseudogap on the whole Fermi surface at low temperature is elucidated.
