At finite temperature, the self-energy correction of the eelctron from its scattering with soft Bosonic mode wll diverge. The authors proposed to resolve such a divergence by including the effect of higher order term in the action of the Bosonic mode. Such higher order term will generate a self-consistent mass in the fluctuation of the Bosonic mode and change the critical behavior of the electron.
